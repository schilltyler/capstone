#### What is a Raspberry Pi?

:::

- The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit card-sized single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
- It was created to promote computer science education and provide an affordable platform for experimentation.
- Despite its small size, it functions as a fully operational computer capable of running various operating systems, primarily Linux-based.
- The Raspberry Pi supports interfacing with sensors and actuators through its general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins, making it suitable for hardware projects.

#### Raspberry Pi vs. Standard Desktop Computer

:::

- **Size and Cost**: The Raspberry Pi is significantly smaller and more affordable than traditional desktop computers.
- **Performance**: While capable, the Raspberry Pi's performance is generally lower due to its compact design and energy efficiency.
- **Expandability**: Desktops offer greater expandability with multiple ports and slots, whereas the Raspberry Pi has limited expansion options.
- **Intended Use**: The Raspberry Pi is designed for education, prototyping, and lightweight tasks, while desktops are built for a broader range of applications, including resource-intensive tasks.

#### Understanding ARM Cortex

:::

- **ARM Cortex**: A family of processors developed by ARM Holdings, known for their energy efficiency and performance.
- **Architecture**: Based on Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC), which simplifies instructions to achieve higher performance per watt.
- **Usage in Raspberry Pi**: Raspberry Pi models utilize ARM Cortex processors, balancing computational power with low energy consumption.
- **Variants**: Includes Cortex-A (applications), Cortex-R (real-time), and Cortex-M (microcontroller) series, each tailored for specific use cases.

#### Y  RPi malware???

:::
- Many devices are powered by the Linux kernel 
- Anything that runs code is  vulnerable to malware. 
- To my knowledge, malware targeting Raspbery Pis specifically is relatively rare
-  Arm is on the rise 
	- Apple Silicon 
	- Mobile Devices
	- Routers
	- IOT
- Malware targeting Linux devices with ARM CPUs is on the rise 
- Raspbery pi i a cost effective way to look at code that will be similar in spirit to that which will be on real systems 
- Time permitting we might look at more realistic scenarios
