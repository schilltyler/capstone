#### What is a Raspberry Pi?

:::

- The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit card-sized single-board computer (SBC).
- Despite its small size, it functions as a fully operational computer capable of running  rich operating systems such as Linux.
- The Raspberry Pi supports interfacing with sensors and actuators through its general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins, making it suitable for hardware projects.
- It is a great first computer for getting started with home labing :)

#### Raspberry Pi vs. Standard Desktop Computer

:::

- Significantly smaller and more affordable than traditional desktop computers.
-  While capable, the Raspberry Pi's performance is generally lower due to its compact design and energy efficiency.
-  The Raspberry Pi is designed for education, prototyping, and lightweight tasks,

#### Y  RPi malware???

:::
- Many devices are powered by the Linux kernel 
- Anything that runs code is  vulnerable to malware. 
- To my knowledge, malware targeting Raspbery Pis specifically is relatively rare
-  Arm is on the rise 
	- Apple Silicon 
	- Mobile Devices
	- Routers
	- IOT
- Malware targeting Linux devices with ARM CPUs is on the rise 
- Raspbery pi i a cost effective way to look at code that will be similar in spirit to that which will be on real systems 
- Time permitting we might look at more realistic scenarios
