# Linux Malware Course 

## Coming Soon: Spring 2025 
### Introduction to Offensive Capabilities Development 
- This is the public repository for Northeastern University as CS-4973/6983


## Brief
The class introduces students to the wild world of offensive capabilities development by taking on the role of both attacker and defender to better understand various stages of cyber attacks. Focusing on the aarch64-linux, students will analyze malware deployed by a simulated threat actor APT-Ch0nkyBear in addition to creating their own tools to emulate their capabilities.

## Capstone 
After spending a fair amount of time tearing apart implants, students will work to create a simple implant complete with basic functionality and a multi user C2 server. 

## Getting Started
- All notes, assignment READMEs and extra content is contained in the ObsidianVault directory.  To open this, please download [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).
- Navigate to ObsidianVault/GettingStarted.md and follow the directions there.
- Please note that while all the files in the Vault are markdown, they are rendered differently on github than they are in Obsidian. 
- Please make sure to carefully follow the directions.
