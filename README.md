## Advanced OS: Payload Creation: Three Easy Pieces  

- This is the public repository for the course listed as Advanced OS

## Brief

This hands-on seminar course introduces students to the fundamentals of offensive cyber capabilities development. Through a scaffolded, three-part curriculum, students will design and implement a multi-stage implant targeting a bespoke sandbox environment. The course culminates in a capstone project where students will have developed a comprehensive capability to gain initial access, execute a payload, and exfiltrate critical data in an operationally secure manner.

### Course snapshot

- Duration: 10 weeks. Studio plus lab.
- Modality: Mix of in person with remote-friendly repos. Required lab section every week.
- Pace: Three parts. Weeks 1–3 IO. Weeks 4–6 payload creation. Weeks 7–10 execution and injection.
- Capstone: Capability targeting a custom sandbox

## Capstone

- While there will be periodic programming assignments, students will spend the bulk of their time creating capabilities that allow them to exfiltrate data from a custom application.
- As the course progresses, the countermeasures in place will become more robust.
- The final environment will require a multi staged capability that is able to exploit vulnerabilities in the application to downsample and exfiltrate data from the target system.

## Getting Started
