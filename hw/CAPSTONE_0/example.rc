# Example RC file for server.py
# Each line is a command that will be executed in order when agent connects
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored

# Get current working directory
pwd

# Download /etc/passwd for analysis
download /etc/passwd

# List the /var/log directory to see what logs are available
ls /var/log

# Tail the syslog file continuously (will run until interrupted or agent disconnects)
# Note: This will block - remove this line if you want the RC to complete and enter interactive mode
tailf /var/log/syslog
